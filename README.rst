FeatureMapper
=============

FeatureMapper coordinates the presentation of input patterns, collating and analyzing the responses to measure 
feature maps, tuning curves, receptive fields, PSTHs, etc. 
As of 5 December 2013, FeatureMapper has just been moved from the Topographica github repository into its
own repository, so it may take a while before it is settled down enough to be completely usable, and in particular
the documentation has not been separated from what is shown on topographica.org.  Watch this space for more details!

Installation
============

FeatureMapper requires `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_, `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, `ImaGen <http://ioam.github.com/imagen/>`_,  and `Param <http://ioam.github.com/param/>`_.
