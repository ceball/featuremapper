FeatureMapper
======

FeatureMapper coordinates the presentation of input patterns, collating and analyzing the responses to measure 
feature maps, tuning curves, PSTHs, etc. 
As of 5 December 2013, FeatureMapper is being  moved from the Topographica github repository  into its
own repository, so  that sometime in the next few days it will be ready to use independently.
